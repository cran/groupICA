Package: groupICA
Title: Independent Component Analysis for Grouped Data
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Niklas Pfister and Sebastian Weichwald
Maintainer: Niklas Pfister <pfister@stat.math.ethz.ch>
Description: Contains an implementation of an independent component analysis (ICA) for grouped data. The main function groupICA() performs a blind source separation, by maximizing an independence across sources and allows to adjust for varying confounding for user-specified groups. Additionally, the package contains the function uwedge() which can be used to approximately jointly diagonalize a list of matrices. For more details see the project website <https://sweichwald.de/groupICA/>.
